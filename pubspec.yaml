  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/image/
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Roboto
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/font/Roboto-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: assets/font/Roboto-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/font/Roboto-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/font/Roboto-Black.ttf
          weight: 900
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/to/font-from-package
